Early stopping is a machine learning technique commonly used to prevent overfitting of a model during training. It will monitor the performance of the model on a validation set during training and stop the training process once the performance stops improving or starts degrading over the threshold.

There are some key components of early stopping:
1. **Monitoring metrics**: The key performance metrics used to monitor training, normally validation loss or accuracy is used.
2. **Patience**: The number of epochs to eait for an improvement over the best performance. This is the threshold of the early stopping technique to stop the training process when the model is not improving.
3. **Saving best model**: When the best performance is tested out, the model will saved the best state so when the early stopping is triggered we still have the model with the best performance.
