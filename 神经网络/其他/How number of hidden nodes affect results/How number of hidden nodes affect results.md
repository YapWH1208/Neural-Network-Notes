# Theory
- The number of nodes in the hidden layer will affect the amount of data processed during both input and output phases, which can also be understood as the hidden layer node count affecting the size of matrices involved.
- For instance, if the input layer has 10 nodes and the hidden layer has 20 nodes:
    - The input layer's matrix will have 10 features, but when passed to the hidden layer, the number of features will increase to 20.
    - This affects how data is processed by the neural network.
- Increasing the number of nodes in the hidden layer can increase the number of features, but sometimes it may introduce noise, potentially leading to errors in the neural network's computations and affecting the final results.

# Conclusion
- The number of nodes in the hidden layer requires fine-tuning, as different datasets may require different parameters. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and it's essential to adjust this parameter accordingly for optimal performance.
