# Convolutional
- Uses kernal to scan through the image
	- The original value * value of kernal = New value

# Pooling
- Max pooing
	- Takes the max value of the sector
	- Prevents the big workload of the model
	- Keeps the features of the images

# Fully- connected layer
- Calculates the probability of the features of the images

# Padding
- Fills 0 at the edges of the images
- This can helps in extracting the feature
